        <h1>Travel Tips </h1>

            <i>Ciudad Perdida:</i> You must bring enough water for the hike, as the trail can be challenging and the weather is often hot. You should wear comfortable shoes, since the terrain can be rugged and steep, making the walk even more demanding. You can explore the ruins with a guide to learn about the ancient Tayrona civilization and its history. If you want to make your experience even better, you could plan your visit during the dry season to avoid heavy rains, which can make the hike more difficult and less enjoyable.

If you enjoy adventure, you can participate in water sports like kitesurfing or windsurfing, which are popular in the area.
